# Lessons learned<hr>
This project provided me with the opportunity to get more knowledge and skills in the planning and design of a multi-page website utilising HTML and CSS through regular research to study new skills. I gained insights into essential aspects such as employing proper semantics, and implementing effective layout techniques. A few challenges met was incoperating new skills learned into my project which took a number of tries to finally succeed. The process of developing this website enhanced my abilities in project management, front-end development, and designs including hovering effects offering valuable lessons that I can readily apply to upcoming projects. In summary, creating a functional website from inception to completion was a highly beneficial and enlightening learning experience.
